# Basic Search Bar in Flutter

## Description
This Flutter project implements a simple search bar that filters a list of items based on user input. The list is dynamically updated as the user types in the search field. This functionality allows users to efficiently search and filter items in real time.

## Features
- **TextField for input**: Users can enter search terms into the TextField.
- **Filter List**: The list of items gets filtered based on the input.
- **Dynamic List Update**: The list updates automatically as the user types.

## How It Works
1. **TextField Input**: The user types a search query into a TextField.
2. **Filtering Logic**: As the user types, the input triggers a function that filters the list of items.
3. **List Update**: The displayed list updates in real time, showing only items that match the search query.

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter**: Framework for building natively compiled applications.
- **Dart**: Programming language used to build the app.
